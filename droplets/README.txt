These are a few batch drag&drop tools (Windows / Linux). Output (processed files) will be generated in _prv/ folder. 

- "atonizer-dir2gltf": drag&drop input folder(s) containing obj files to be processed and converted (draconized glTF + texture optimization)
- "atonizer-dir2glb": same as atonizer-dir2gltf, but using glb (merged geometries + textures)
